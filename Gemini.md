# Project Gemini: Feature Implementation Summary

This document outlines the recent features implemented in the Next.js application.

## 1. Contact Import from Excel/CSV

- **Feature:** Users can now import contacts from an Excel or CSV file.
- **Implementation:**
  - The `import-contacts-dialog.tsx` component was updated to include a file upload and parsing functionality using the `xlsx` library.
  - The frontend reads the file, extracts contact information (phone, name, email), and sends it to the backend.
  - Error handling and user feedback (toasts) were added for a smoother user experience.

## 2. Bulk Contact Import API

- **Feature:** A new API endpoint was created to handle the efficient import of multiple contacts at once.
- **Implementation:**
  - A new route was added at `/api/contacts/bulk`.
  - The backend was updated with a new controller, service, and model function (`createBulkContacts`) to handle the bulk insertion of contacts into the database.
  - The frontend was updated to use this new endpoint, improving the performance of the contact import feature.

## 3. Pagination for Contacts List

- **Feature:** The main contacts list now supports pagination to handle a large number of contacts efficiently.
- **Implementation:**
  - The backend API (`/api/contacts`) was updated to accept `page` and `limit` query parameters.
  - The frontend `useContacts` hook was updated to manage the current page and send the correct parameters to the API.
  - Pagination controls (Previous/Next buttons) were added to the contacts page UI.
  - The number of contacts displayed per page is set to 6.

## 4. Search Functionality for Contacts

- **Feature:** Users can now search for contacts by name.
- **Implementation:**
  - The backend API (`/api/contacts`) was updated to accept a `search` query parameter to filter contacts by name.
  - The frontend `useContacts` hook was updated to include the search term in the API request.
  - A search input was added to the contacts page UI to allow users to enter their search query.

## 5. Search Functionality for Templates

- **Feature:** Users can now search for templates by name in the new campaign page.
- **Implementation:**
  - The `Combobox` component was updated to support a search input.
  - The `useTemplates` hook was updated to accept a search term and pass it to the API.
  - The backend API (`/api/templates`) was updated to filter templates by name based on the search query.

## 6. Bug Fixes

- **`handleSelectAllContacts` not found:** Fixed a bug in the new campaign page where the "Select All" checkbox was not working.
- **Campaign creation crash:** Fixed a bug that caused the server to crash when creating a campaign due to a database error.
- **Message creation crash:** Fixed a bug that caused the server to crash when creating a message due to a database error.

## 7. Chat Assignment Feature

- **Feature:** Admins can assign chats to specific team members. Team members can only view and reply to chats assigned to them.
- **Implementation Details:**
    - **Database:**
        - Added a `role` column to the `users` table (`admin` or `member`).
        - Added an `assignedToUserId` foreign key to the `contacts` table to link conversations to team members.
    - **Backend API:**
        - New endpoint `POST /api/contacts/[contactId]/assign` for admins to assign chats.
        - Modified `GET /api/contacts` and `GET /api/chats` to be role-aware. Admins see all chats; team members see only their assigned chats.
    - **Frontend UI:**
        - Admins will have a UI element (e.g., a dropdown) in the chat list to assign conversations.
        - The chat list will visually indicate who each chat is assigned to.
        - Team members will see a pre-filtered list of their assigned chats upon login.
