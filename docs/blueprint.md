## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#3F51B5), inspired by a professional business setting with modern elements; it's trustworthy without being dull. Use with light text and accents for a bold look.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5). Using a light scheme overall contributes to legibility; gray provides the needed contrast while being muted.
- Accent color: Vibrant violet (#7E57C2), for a clear visual indicator different from the primary; applied to less-frequent UI actions.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a modern, digital aesthetic.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for readability and a clean, neutral look in longer text blocks.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for displaying code snippets.
- Responsive 12-column grid layout to adapt to different screen sizes.
- Simple, consistent icons to represent different functions and statuses. The icon set must communicate modernity and efficiency.
